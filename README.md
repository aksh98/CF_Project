# Predicting your Soulmate

The DTI_pred algorithm implementation can be found in the ipython notebook titled [Baseline_DTI-Pred.ipynb](https://github.com/devishi/CF_Project/blob/master/Baseline_DTI_Pred.ipynb) and the PUCPI algorithm implementation can be found in the [PUPCI.ipynb](https://github.com/devishi/CF_Project/blob/master/PUCPI.ipynb) written in Google Colab IPython Notebooks.
We've also implemented these baselines for the paper. i.e.
- Singular Value Decomposition
- Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
- Normal Predictor


The Paper/Report is available here: ["Predicting your Soulmate"](https://github.com/devishi/CF_Project/blob/master/CF_ProjectReport.pdf).
